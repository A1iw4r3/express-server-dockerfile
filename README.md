# express-server-dockerfile
node-express-server

# Description
This Dockerfile is designed for a Node.js application. It starts by using the latest Node.js image as its base. It exposes port 3000 and sets the working directory to '/app'. It then copies the 'server.js' file into the container's '/app' directory, installs the Express framework using npm, and specifies the command to run the Node.js application with 'server.js' as the entry point. This Dockerfile is suitable for deploying a Node.js application using Express.
